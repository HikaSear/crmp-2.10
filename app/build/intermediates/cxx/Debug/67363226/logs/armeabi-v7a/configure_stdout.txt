-- The following features have been enabled:

 * OPUS_ENABLE_FLOAT_API, compile with the floating point API (for machines with float library).
 * OPUS_HARDENING, run-time checks that are cheap and safe for use in production.
 * OPUS_INSTALL_PKG_CONFIG_MODULE, install pkg-config module.
 * OPUS_INSTALL_CMAKE_CONFIG_MODULE, install CMake package config module.
 * OPUS_VAR_ARRAYS, use variable length arrays for stack arrays.
 * OPUS_STACK_PROTECTOR, use stack protection.
 * OPUS_FORTIFY_SOURCE, add protection against buffer overflows.

-- The following REQUIRED packages have been found:

 * shadowhook

-- The following features have been disabled:

 * OPUS_BUILD_SHARED_LIBRARY, build shared library.
 * OPUS_BUILD_TESTING, build tests.
 * OPUS_CUSTOM_MODES, enable non-Opus modes, e.g. 44.1 kHz & 2^n frames.
 * OPUS_BUILD_PROGRAMS, build programs.
 * OPUS_DISABLE_INTRINSICS, disable all intrinsics optimizations.
 * OPUS_FIXED_POINT, compile as fixed-point (for machines without a fast enough FPU).
 * OPUS_FLOAT_APPROX, enable floating point approximations (Ensure your platform supports IEEE 754 before enabling).
 * OPUS_ASSERTIONS, additional software error checking.
 * OPUS_FUZZING, causes the encoder to make random decisions (do not use in production).
 * OPUS_CHECK_ASM, enable bit-exactness checks between optimized and c implementations.
 * OPUS_FIXED_POINT_DEBUG, debug fixed-point implementation.
 * OPUS_USE_ALLOCA, use alloca for stack arrays (on non-C99 compilers).
 * OPUS_NONTHREADSAFE_PSEUDOSTACK, use a non threadsafe pseudostack when neither variable length arrays or alloca is supported.
 * OPUS_FAST_MATH, enable fast math (unsupported and discouraged use, as code is not well tested with this build option).

-- The following OPTIONAL packages have not been found:

 * Git
